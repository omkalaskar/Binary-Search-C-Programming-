# Binary-Search-C-Programming-
This repository provides a simple Binary Search implementation in C. Binary Search is an efficient algorithm with O(log n) time complexity, used to quickly find the position of a target element in a sorted array.

The program includes:

Taking user input for array elements.

Sorting the array (if necessary).

Implementing Binary Search (iterative or recursive).

Returning the index of the target element if found.

This project is perfect for beginners to understand searching algorithms and practice C programming.
